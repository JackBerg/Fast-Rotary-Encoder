Hello & Welcome to my page
this simple Arduino code is for a Optical Rotary Encoder with TTL output pulse A,B
when connected , the code will detect the sense of rotation, upon detecting a left or right rotation
a timing pulse is provide on 2 different output pin.
This setup (Arduino+Rotary) does not require any debouncing circuit, it's use instead
the states of input A and B as switch or TTL driver to detect and enable a one shot latching pulse on 
either direction.

Feel free to use theses codes, and does not contain any warranty.

Thank's for sharing
